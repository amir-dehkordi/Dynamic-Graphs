# Predicting Citi Bike System Demand 

**Author**: Amir Mohammad B.Dehkordi

## objectives

-	introduce an optimized graph deep learning architecture for predicting demand for Citi bike sharing
-	 include weather data in the model for better accuracy accuracy in predicting demand 

## Overview
at first stage we used the Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Forecasting which is introduced by Bing Yu et al at, for each station due to the limitation of access of capacity of stations we consider inbound and outbound of each station in 30 minutes time step

## Data
Live feed station data and trip history is available through [CitiBikeâ€™s open system data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data).Stations and bikes have a unique id that allows the joining of information between datasets. The project will focus on data from 2023/06e.


## Exploratory_data_analysis
- EDA1--1st part
- EDA2--2nd part

## NOTCE

- Process_data file will be added to the repository as the objectives project reaches the conclusion .
- new alogorthms which is writing in A Spatial-Temporal Graph Attentional Long Short-Term Memory (STGA-LSTM) neural network framework to predict short-run bike-sharing demand at a station level using multi-source data sets will be added to the repository as the objectives project reaches the conclusion
